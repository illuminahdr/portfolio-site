    <h1>Addressing Social Segregation in Student Leadership Board and the Wider Student Body</h1>
    <p>Dear Mdm Teo,</p>
    <p>I am writing to bring attention to a growing divide in our school community, one that stems from the social segregation between student leaders and their peers. It is becoming more evident that students in leadership positions, mainly the Students’ Council, Prefectorial Board and the Class Management Committee, are often interacting primarily within their circle of friends. Meanwhile, students who are not part of their group frequently feel excluded, creating a social hierarchy that ends up affecting the inclusivity and overall student morale, likewise to my situation.</p>
    <p>For example, during school events and daily interactions, student leaders are often seen engaging only amongst themselves, whether in the canteen, along corridors, or even in class projects. This behaviour unintentionally fosters an “in‑group” mentality, as these student leaders are more familiar with each other and do not want to engage with others whom they deem unfamiliar. This makes other students feel unwelcome in conversations, ultimately putting them off from interacting with student leaders. As such, this bias gives rise to the divide between student leaders and the other students. Some students have even voiced out that they hesitate to talk to them as often; the students end up being left out and not feel included entirely. I undoubtedly side with them.</p>
    <p>Over time, this divide can have detrimental effects on students. The most significant one is the withdrawal from social interactions as many students who do not possess a student leadership role may feel disengaged from the larger school community, believing that their voices are not heard. As such, this leads to students wanting to opt out of events and withdraw from social interactions with peers due to how they perceive their opinions to be “worthless”.</p>
    <p>This will then contribute to mental health decline. Social interaction is essential in having good mental health. Thus, if a student were to lack this, it can lead a student into melancholy, due to the myriad of effects mental health decline can cause. The primary one being that a student’s grade can suffer immensely. If a student’s mental state is unstable, they would often lack the motivation to study and often choose to tend to their feelings. As such, little revision would be done, affecting the student’s grade. Furthermore, due to the segregation of students, this student in question would not be able to seek help from peers, exacerbating the problem.</p>
    <p>While there is a possible view that a student can learn to manage on their own, this is oversimplifying the problem. Not all students have the same level of access to resources or support systems, caused by the divide. Some students may struggle with time management, self‑discipline, or even understanding where to start, leading to stress and disengagement. Without a more inclusive and supportive environment, those who are naturally extroverted or already in leadership roles may continue to thrive, while others fall behind— not due to a lack of ability, but because they lack the same opportunities to develop these skills.</p>
    <p>Thus, to tackle the issue, I have provided the root causes and solutions, for your reference.</p>
    <p><strong>There are several factors in play, contributing to the causes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Structural barriers:</strong> Leadership positions often have exclusive meetings, camps, privileges and opportunities that naturally separate them from the student body.</li>
      <li><strong>Social reinforcement:</strong> As students tend to spend more time with those they are familiar with, these groups form tight bonds which can make it hard for other students to integrate into.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>To bridge this divide, I propose the following measures, for your reference:</strong></p>
    <p>Firstly, there should be more mixed group initiatives. For example, during projects, teachers could potentially encourage students to pair up with those they are unfamiliar with, to allow for more interaction among students. Thus, there will be an equal divide of student leaders and non‑student leaders in each group.</p>
    <p>Additionally, there can be more joint activities. For instance, there could be more team‑building days or inter‑group competitions among students, such as every morning during morning assembly. Currently, there are very few days dedicated to this, limiting the chance for students to interact with other students. Thus, through these activities, this can break down social barriers and allow for more avenues for students to engage with each other, breaking away from the bias.</p>
    <p>Addressing this issue is essential to fostering an inclusive and engaged school community. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss these ideas further to create a school environment where all students feel valued and connected. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Nyi&nbsp;Nyi Phyo Lwin Raymond<br>Class 4‑1</p>
