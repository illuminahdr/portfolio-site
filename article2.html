    <h1>Design Principles for the Modern Web</h1>
    <p>Great design transcends aesthetics; itâ€™s about crafting experiences that are intuitive, accessible and delightful. The modern web demands designs that not only look beautiful but also perform flawlessly across a myriad of devices and connection speeds.</p>
    <p>Minimalism continues to rule, emphasising clarity and focus. Responsive design ensures that content adapts seamlessly from large desktop monitors to the smallest of smartphones. Accessibility is no longer optional; inclusive design practices mean more people can engage with our creations. And under the surface, performance optimisation makes sure those experiences load quickly and feel effortless.</p>
    <p>By adhering to these principles, we not only build sites that please the eye but also serve users in meaningful ways. As technology continues to evolve, so too must our approach to design, always putting people at the centre of our work.</p>
