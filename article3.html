    <h1>The Future of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>Artificial intelligence has transitioned from a futuristic concept to a core technology underpinning many of today’s innovations. As algorithms become more sophisticated and datasets expand, AI’s capabilities are growing at an exponential rate.</p>
    <p>In the coming years, we can expect AI to move beyond the realm of automation and into augmentation—enhancing human creativity, decision‑making and productivity. From personalised education platforms that adapt to individual learning styles to medical systems that predict and prevent diseases before they occur, the potential applications are vast and transformative.</p>
    <p>However, with great power comes great responsibility. Ensuring that AI is developed ethically and transparently will be key to realising its benefits while mitigating risks. By fostering open dialogue and thoughtful regulation, we can guide AI towards a future that benefits all of humanity.</p>
